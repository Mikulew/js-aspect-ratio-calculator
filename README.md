## General info

**In mathematics**, a ratio indicates how many times one number contains another. For example, if there are eight oranges and six lemons in a bowl of fruit, then **the ratio** of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, _8∶6_, which is equivalent to **the ratio** _4∶3_). Similarly, **the ratio** of lemons to oranges is _6∶8_ (or _3∶4_) and **the ratio** of oranges to the total amount of fruit is _8∶14_ (or _4∶7_).

The numbers in **a ratio** may be quantities of any kind, such as counts of people or objects, or such as measurements of lengths, weights, time, etc. In most contexts, both numbers are restricted to be positive.

**A ratio** may be specified either by giving both constituting numbers, written as _a_ to _b_ or _a∶b_, or by giving just the value of their quotient _a/b_. Equal quotients correspond to equal **ratios**.

Consequently, **a ratio** may be considered as an ordered pair of numbers, a fraction with **the first number** in the _numerator_ and **the second** in the _denominator_, or as the value denoted by this fraction. **Ratios of counts**, given by (non-zero) natural numbers, are rational numbers, and may sometimes be natural numbers. When two quantities are measured with the same unit, as is often the case, **their ratio** is _a dimensionless number_. A quotient of two quantities that are measured with different units is called a rate.

We use **the ratio formula** while comparing the relationship between two numbers or quantities. **The ratio** is defined as the relation between the quantities of two or more objects and it indicates the amount of one object contained in the other. The general form of representing **a ratio** of two quantities say _a_ and _b_ is

>a : b

where,

_a_ = **Antecedent**

_b_ = **Consequent**

## Display aspect ratio

**The aspect ratio** of a display device is the proportional relationship between the _width_ and the _height_ of the display. Common **aspect ratios** for displays, past and present, include _5:4_, _4:3_, _16:10_ and _16:9_.
